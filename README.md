# digitPredicter
A program that predicts the digit that you write.

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>

Here is my digit classifier. I am implementing this by logistic regression.


<h6>TRAINER CLASS:</h6>
This class is to traing the model. <br>
<h6>PREDICTOR CLASS:</h6>
This class is to predict the digit by given parameters<br>
<h6>MAIN CLASS:</h6>
This class is to test Trainer and Predicter class.<br>
      
<h3>RESULTS:</h3>
Accuracy was %96 on dataset but the tones of colors in the images in dataset was a little different also there was only 5000 images which is so small compare to even 2 MB dataset. So predictions may not be well with different kind of images with digits (backaground color etc.). To overcome this, i need a bigger dataset with more realistic digits.
